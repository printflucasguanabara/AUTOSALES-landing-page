# Challenges During Programming

This was the challenge where I struggled the most with JavaScript, even though it's a simple code. Although I couldn't make the background or the color of some texts change in real-time, I added a button that simulates what should happen in real-time. Centering objects, using divs for positioning and resizing images, working with backgrounds, and faithfully constructing the layout were the main challenges during this coding.

<br>

## Layout
I started by developing the wireframe in FIGMA.

I was going to add the colors and create a detailed layout, but I decided to go to the code with HTML and CSS and detail the colors on the go.

# Responsiveness with Media Queries

his aspect provides a varied user experience for different devices, which demanded a lot from me and my knowledge. I learned many new positioning techniques and other valuable knowledge.

# The JS 
It's a simple JavaScript code, ~~although I struggled a bit with it~~. It changes the background image and text colors on a web page with the click of a button.
### Features:
<li> Changes the background image of the page. </li>
<li>Changes text colors for various elements, including headings, paragraphs, buttons, and navigation links.</li>

### How It Works
When the "Change Time" button is clicked, the changeBackgroundAndTextColors() function is called.
<li>It updates the background image of the page.</li>
<li>Selects all desired text elements and updates their text colors based on the current index.</li>

# Detailed Time Zones Acces

I added a button in the upper-left corner that simulates what users can see when the landing page's appearance changes during specific time periods:
# <li>05:00 to 12:00</li>

# <li>12:00 to 18:00</li>

# <li>18:00 to 05:00</li>

## Despite being a simple landing page, I learned from some mistakes and put my knowledge in practice.
 Mesmo sendo um Landing Page simples, consegui aprender com alguns erros e coloquei em pr√°tica meus conhecimentos
